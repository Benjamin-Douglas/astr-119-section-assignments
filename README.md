# astr-119-section-assignments
A fun but convoluted way to make sure everyone in ASTR 119 has a Section!


## Here are your instructions:

* Look at the Issues tab.  Find your name in the list of issues, and note the corresponding issue number.
* Go to the Code tab, and create a branch "firstname-lastinitial-section".
* Upload a python program called "hello-world-firstname-lastinitial.py"

```
#/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello from [your name].")
```

* Create a pull request to add this code to the repository.
* In the comments for the pull request, note your preference for a Section assignment (M or F).  If you already have an officially assigned Section, note that instead and verify which one.
* In the comments for the pull request, also add "Closes #[number]" where [number] corresponds to the Issue number with your name.
* Do not include any additional personal information!

* I will merge the pull request and note which Section you are assigned to (you may not get your first choice!).
* Also feel free to note which name and pronouns you prefer.
